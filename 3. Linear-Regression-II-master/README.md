# Linear-Regression-II
Polynomial forms, classical assumptions

For this topic you have two assignments,
1) Using the Wages dataset, conduct the various tests for OLS violations used in the Boston.ipynb notebook. In the same notebook, report on the results of the test, highlighting any violations and your steps to correct for them. 

2) Using the boston dataset, create a polynomial regression for any non-linear variables you identify. Report the MSE of non-transformed (linear) OLS fit and the transformed polynomial regression MSE.
