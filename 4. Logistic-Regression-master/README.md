# Logistic-Regression

Here is the description for the Banking dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing

The task for today is to use the Logistic Regression to predict the default rates for customers at a lending institution, especially looking at students lending.

To complete this you need to:

1) Change the predictors into variables that can be inputed into a Logistic Regression
2) Analyse and visualize the data BEFORE fitting the model. I want to know you hypothesis on the relationship between balance, income and student status on default rates.
3) Train the model and report the confusion matrix and the AUROC (this curve should be visualized in your notebook)
